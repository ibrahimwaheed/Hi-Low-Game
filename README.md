# High-Low Game

### I. Initiative
This is a gambling game where the user guesses whether the number they roll is higher or lower than the number the computer has rolled on a 10 sided dice.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics
 * Allowing user input to enter whether their number will be higher or lower
 * Generator that randomly produces numbers from 1-10 for both players
 * Compares the numbers that have been produced in order to see which player wins

##### Non-Functional Requirements
* Give instructions to users in order for player to known what they need to do
* Ask the user if they would like to play again
* See what numbers have been rolled by each character

##### User Stories
* As a player, I would like to see the numbers that were generated on screen
* As a player, I would like to input my prediction on whether the number that I roll is higher or lower
* As a player, I would like to be able to play again at the end of the game so that i don't have to restart the application again





##### How We Addressed The Requirements

The program will address the requirements as it will use a randomiser function in order to generate random numbers from 1-10
