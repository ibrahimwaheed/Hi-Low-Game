# High-Low Game

### I. Initiative
This is a gambling game where the user guesses whether the number they roll is higher or lower than the number the computer has rolled on a 10 sided dice.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics
 * Allowing user input to enter whether their number will be higher or lower
 * Generator that randomly produces numbers from 1-10 for both players
 * Compares the numbers that have been produced in order to see which player wins

##### Non-Functional Requirements
* Give instructions to users in order for player to known what they need to do
* Ask the user if they would like to play again
* See what numbers have been rolled by each character

##### User Stories
* As a player, I would like to see the numbers that were generated on screen
* As a player, I would like to input my prediction on whether the number that I roll is higher or lower
* As a player, I would like to be able to play again at the end of the game so that i don't have to restart the application again





##### How We Addressed The Requirements

The program will address the requirements as it will use a randomiser function in order to generate random numbers from 1-10 and will then display this for the computer and player respectively, before the players number is rolled though the program would ask the player whether they think their number will be higher or lower than the one the computer rolled. After the player has made their choice the program continues and then displays the players number and depending on whether the user guessed right or wrong the program shows either a You win or lose message, the program then asks the user whether they would like another turn or not, if the user chooses no then the programme closes while if they choose yes then the game returns to the beginning and loops this function.
