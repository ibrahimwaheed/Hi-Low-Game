# High-Low Game

### I. Initiative
This is a gambling game where the user guesses whether the number they roll is higher or lower than the number the computer has rolled on a 10 sided dice.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics
 * Allowing user input to enter whether their number will be higher or lower
 * Generator that randomly produces numbers from 1-10 for both players
 * Compares the numbers that have been produced in order to see which player wins

##### Non-Functional Requirements
* Give instructions to users in order for player to known what they need to do
* Ask the user if they would like to play again
* See what numbers have been rolled by each character

##### User Stories
* As a player, I would like to see the numbers that were generated on screen
* As a player, I would like to input my prediction on whether the number that I roll is higher or lower
* As a player, I would like to be able to play again at the end of the game so that i don't have to restart the application again





##### How We Addressed The Requirements

The program will address the requirements as it will use a randomiser function in order to generate random numbers from 1-10 and will then display this for the computer and player respectively, before the players number is rolled though the program would ask the player whether they think their number will be higher or lower than the one the computer rolled. After the player has made their choice the program continues and then displays the players number and depending on whether the user guessed right or wrong the program shows either a You win or lose message, the program then asks the user whether they would like another turn or not, if the user chooses no then the programme closes while if they choose yes then the game returns to the beginning and loops this function.

### III. Genre
This game would fall under the genre of Gambling as the player is playing against a computer and they are gambling on the chance of the player getting a number that is either higher or lower than the computers number and then either winning or losing the game as there is no way to predict what number the player will get.
### IV. Technical Details

##### Platform


##### Programming Language/Enviroment
The language used to create the program was C++ this was because it enabled us to use an IDE which was extremely helpful as it allowed us to see if we were making any errors as we were coding which made it easier to spot mistakes as they are made which dramatically reduces the time taken to create a program as there won't be as much syntax errors.

##### Programming Challenges
State the programing challenges you are trying to overcome
The programming challenges that needed to be overcome were problems such as how was the program able to repeat the process until the user didn't want to play again. Another problem that needs to be overcome is the random number generator, this needs to be overcome as it will make the game more challenging since the player won't know what number will be used each time.
