# Calendar

### I. Initiative
The aim of this project is to create a command line text based program that is able to read and write calendar entries from a text file. The program will be required to:
- Display all of the calendar entries and display them into a readable format.
- Be able to enter new calendar entries into the text file.
- edit the current entries in the file if there are discrepancies.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics
Outlining the main fuctions of the game
- Read calendar entries
- Edit calendar entries
- Display calendar dates
- Enter new dates into the calendar


##### Non-Functional Requirements
Asthetic or non essential requirements
- Sort the calendar dates
- Allow multiple files to be read
- Format the output to look like a traditional calendar.
##### User Stories
As a User, I would like to be able to edit the calendar files in order to correct any errors that are made.
As a User, I would like to enter new dates into the calendar to ensure no new appointment is forgotten
